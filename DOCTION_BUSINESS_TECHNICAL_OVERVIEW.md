# Doction: Healthcare Provider Matching Platform
## Business & Technical Overview

---

## üè• **BUSINESS MODEL OVERVIEW**

### **Core Concept**
Doction is a "reverse marketplace" for surgeries and dental procedures where:
- Patients upload existing quotes/estimates they've received
- Healthcare providers can view these requests and offer better deals/counter-quotes
- AI facilitates matching and negotiation between patients and providers

### **Target Market**
- **Primary**: Procedures where patients shop around (orthodontics, jaw surgery, cosmetic procedures)
- **Secondary**: Out-of-pocket medical procedures not heavily covered by insurance
- **Geographic Focus**: Starting with Austin, TX and LA markets

### **Revenue Streams**

#### 1. **Provider Subscription Fee**
- **Amount**: $5,000/month per practitioner
- **Model**: Free until first client acquired via platform
- **Payment**: Automated Stripe invoicing after first successful client booking
- **Value Prop**: High ROI (one jaw surgery @ $20k+ justifies monthly fee)

#### 2. **Appointment Setting Fee**
- **Amount**: $75 per Calendly booking
- **Trigger**: Automatic charge when patient books consultation with provider
- **Integration**: Calendly webhook ‚Üí Stripe payment from provider's saved payment method

#### 3. **Fight Mode Premium Feature**
- **Amount**: $20/month subscription for patients
- **Function**: AI agent negotiates on patient's behalf for better prices/terms
- **Alternative**: $5 per negotiation attempt (pay-per-use)

#### 4. **Data Monetization** (Future)
- Anonymized pricing data sold to market research firms, insurance companies
- Healthcare analytics companies interested in procedure cost trends

### **Go-to-Market Strategy**
1. **Provider Acquisition**: Use public NPI registry to pre-populate provider database
2. **Patient Acquisition**: Target Reddit forums (r/jawsurgery, etc.), Instagram/TikTok ads
3. **Local Market Focus**: Austin/LA healthcare networks, hire local sales reps
4. **Community Outreach**: Patient forums where people seek cost-effective medical solutions
